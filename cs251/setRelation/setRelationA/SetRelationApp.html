<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment builds on the Functions application.&nbsp; In the Functions program, the user entered two set rosters, and you counted all of the relations that were functions of various types.&nbsp; In this assignment you are counting relations that meet the other criteria identified in the course material.&nbsp; Recall, the 13 relation properties identified in CS 251 are</p>
<ol>
<li>Domain consumption</li>
<li>Unique image</li>
<li>Injection</li>
<li>Surjection</li>
<li>Reflexive</li>
<li>Symmetric</li>
<li>Transitive</li>
<li>Not Reflexive</li>
<li>Not Symmetric</li>
<li>Not Transitive</li>
<li>Anti Reflexive</li>
<li>Anti Symmetric</li>
<li>Anti Transitive</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these properties, you can identify the following categories of relations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions, which satisfy (1) &amp; (2)</li>
<li>Bijective Functions, which satisfy (1), (2), (3), and (4)</li>
<li>Equivalence relations, which satisfy (5), (6), and (7)</li>
<li>Partial Order relations, which satisfy (5), (7), and (12)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Write a C++ program that performs the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept a list of<em></em> elements on a single line (separated by spaces). &nbsp;The elements are strings (with no embedded spaces), and there will be no more than 4 elements in this roster. This is set A.&nbsp; Note that you must count the number of elements entered by the user on the line in order to determine the set size.&nbsp; This set will never be empty.<br><br></li>
<li>Accept a second list of&nbsp; elements on a single line (separated by spaces). The elements are strings (with no embedded spaces), and there will be no more than 4 elements in this roster.&nbsp; This is set B. Note that you must count the number of elements entered by the user on the line in order to determine the set size.&nbsp; This set will never be empty.<br><br></li>
<li>Display each of the following:</li>
<ol>
<li>The number of injective functions from A to B.&nbsp; List all of the injective&nbsp; functions in set notation.</li>
<li>The number of equivalence relations on A.&nbsp; List all of the equivalence relations in set notation.</li>
<li>The number of partial order relations on B.&nbsp; List all of the partial order relations in set notation.</li>
</ol></ol>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>Note the possible cardinalities: if A and B both have 4 elements, then the cross products will have 16 elements, which is a reasonable number.&nbsp; The power set of the cross-product will have 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 elements, which is a larger number.&nbsp; Note that of those 65,536 set relations, you will have at most&nbsp; 256 functions, 24 injective functions, and 15 equivalence relations (the counting details will become clear in the next module).</p>
<p>Try to avoid extensive testing of all relations - that can cause excessive runtimes for your program.&nbsp; Before testing any of the 13 relation criteria, check set cardinality: any relation whose cardinality is less than the cardinality of the domain can not be a function, equivalence relation, or partial order relation since all elements of the domain must participate in these relations (due to domain consumption and reflexivity).</p>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Submit your main.cpp file only to the dropbox. &nbsp;Do not include any project files or executable files - just the source code. &nbsp;Your program must compile and execute in PCC's linux environment.</p>
