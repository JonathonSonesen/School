# **School Projects**
This repository includes applications that I am writing while attending
Portland Community College and seeking my A.S Transfer degree in computer science. Some of the programs 
are written entirely by me and others are built from starter code my instructors
provided, where applicable I will try to note such things in the header of those
files. Additionally, there are latex documents and code for my required math classes and assignments. 

#**Current Class List**

* CS162 Computer Science II<BR>
     * Explores classes, pointers, dynamic memory, linear linked lists, multi-dimensional arrays, program correctness, verification, and testing.<BR> 

* CS201 Computer Systems<BR>
     * Introduces computer systems from a software perspective. Provides an overview of C and assembly language programming and reading skills. Explores basic systems programming skills and tools to measure and improve program performance based on an understanding of key aspects of machine architecture.<BR>

* CS250 Discrete Structures I<BR>
     * Introduces discrete structures and computational techniques in the areas of first-order logic, discrete proofs, number theory, sequences, induction, recursion, and set theory.<BR>

* CS251 Discrete Structures II <BR>
     * Introduces discrete structures and computational techniques in the areas of functions, relations, probability, graph theory, algorithm analysis, and finite state automata.

#**Collaborating**<BR>
This is public and open source for ease of collaboration with classmates. Folks who view this code should understand that while this is available to be read by you, cloning this repository and copy/pasting this code will not help you in any way and will get you in trouble with your instructors. This is strictly reference material, and pretty much everything I have written is a derivation of various examples from textbooks and other resources. For example say you have completed an assignment and would like to see someone elses take on that particular algorithm. This is a repsoitory you can use for that<BR>

I am happy to consider suggestions on improvements or changes so if you see something that could be done a diferent way please feel free to submit pull requests implementing those changes. When collaborating please be sure to document your changes well, explain why you think a method is better than another or why and how your changes work, it makes it way easier for everyone to learn that way; this is all educational so lets share that knowledge ya'll!
