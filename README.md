School projects PCC
Every term PCC wipes your server account, and because of this I have
chosen to keep all of my school work on Github, this repo includes
c++ and c projects, some are simple and dumb, some are slightly
more complex and smart. Feel free to review my code, give me suggestions
etc. I am a glutton for criticism.
