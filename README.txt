This repository includes applications that I am writing while attending
Portland Community College and seeking my A.S Transfer degree in computer scoence. Some of the programs 
are written entirely by me and others are built from starter code my instructors
provided, where applicable I will try to note such things in the header of those
files. Additionally, there are latex documents and code for my required math classes and assignments.
