# **School Projects**
This repository includes applications that I am writing while attending
Portland Community College and seeking my A.S Transfer degree in computer science. Some of the programs 
are written entirely by me and others are built from starter code my instructors
provided, where applicable I will try to note such things in the header of those
files. Additionally, there are latex documents and code for my required math classes and assignments. This is public for ease of collaboration with classmates. Others you view this code should understand that while this is available to be read by you, cloning this repository and copy/pasting this code will not help you in any way and will get you in trouble with your instructors. This is strictly reference material, and pretty much everything I have written is a derivation of various examples from textbooks and other resources. For example say you have completed an assignment and would like to see someone elses take on that particular algorithm. This is a repsoitory you can use for that<BR>

**Current Application List**
* Django-Stripe Payment Processing Example (Django 1.8 Python 2.7)  <BR>
     * This application utilizes the Stripe api to process credit card payments, and submit a contact form. Also, it uses Twitter Bootstrap,  Django-Crispy-Forms and Django-Allauth to allow users to sign up and run a test payment of 10$ on Stripe's servers. You can [check it out here](https://jonsonesen.pythonanywhere.com "django-example") once there you can sign up and click on the checkout option and submit a test payment using stripes test credentials. Created while following [this](https://www.udemy.com/learn-django-code-accept-payments-with-stripe/#/ "django-example") free tutorial .
